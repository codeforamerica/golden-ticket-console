Golden Ticket (Console)
============

RI Pre-Kindergarten Lottery Console Application. From a command prompt, it runs the pre-k lottery based on lottery registration data collected in CSV format. The output is the following:

- A list of selected students by school
- A list of wait listed students by school
- A series of lists by school that show the various steps of the selection process (provides transparency/accountability for the running of the app)

This app was used to run the 2014-2015 Pre-K Lottery for the Rhode Island Department of Education in conjunction with a Google Form used by parents to register their child. This process was used to see if the process would work better for parents and make the administration of the lottery easier/quicker/more fair. It was, so a [next iteration of the project](http://github.com/codeforamerica/golden-ticket) is going to be developed that is more of an end-to-end solution that contains web-based interfaces both for the registration process and for the administration of the lottery selection process.

The previous name of the project was RIPL, so that's why some packages and classes contain that acronym.
